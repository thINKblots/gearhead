Problem: Engine starts but loses power under load after 30 minutes
Equipment: Caterpillar 320D Excavator
Error Codes: P0087, SPN 157
Cause: Fuel filter restriction causing low fuel pressure when warm
Solution: Replace primary and secondary fuel filters. Bleed fuel system to remove air. Check fuel pressure meets specification (280-320 bar at operating temperature). Inspect fuel lines for restrictions.

Problem: Hydraulic system responds slowly, bucket curl weak under load
Equipment: John Deere 644K Loader
Error Codes: None
Cause: Low hydraulic fluid or worn hydraulic pump with insufficient output pressure
Solution: Check hydraulic fluid level and top up if needed. Test pump output pressure (should be 2500-2800 PSI). If pressure is low, rebuild or replace hydraulic pump. Replace hydraulic filter.

Problem: Transmission slipping in 3rd gear, especially when machine is cold
Equipment: Komatsu PC200-8 Excavator
Error Codes: P0735
Cause: Worn clutch pack in 3rd gear assembly or low transmission fluid
Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If level is correct, perform pressure test on 3rd gear circuit. Inspect and replace 3rd gear clutch pack assembly if worn. Update transmission control software if TSB available.

Problem: Engine cranks but won't start, no smoke from exhaust
Equipment: Volvo EC480D Excavator
Error Codes: P0340, P0335
Cause: Faulty crankshaft position sensor or camshaft position sensor preventing ECM from determining engine position
Solution: Test crankshaft position sensor resistance (should be 500-1500 ohms). Test camshaft position sensor resistance. Replace sensor that is out of specification. Check sensor wiring for damage. Clear codes and verify engine starts.

Problem: Engine overheating after 45 minutes of operation
Equipment: Case 580 Backhoe
Error Codes: None
Cause: Cooling system restriction or faulty thermostat
Solution: Check coolant level and top up if needed. Inspect radiator for blockage or debris. Test thermostat operation (should open at 180-190°F). Check water pump for proper operation. Pressure test cooling system for leaks. Clean radiator fins if restricted.

Problem: Excessive black smoke from exhaust under load
Equipment: Caterpillar 320D Excavator
Error Codes: P0101, P0234
Cause: Turbocharger boost pressure too high or air filter restriction
Solution: Inspect air filter and replace if dirty. Test turbocharger boost pressure (should not exceed 2.5 bar). Check for intake air leaks. Inspect turbocharger wastegate operation. Test MAF sensor output.

Problem: Loader bucket drifts down when hydraulic control lever is in hold
Equipment: John Deere 644K Loader
Error Codes: None
Cause: Internal leakage in bucket cylinder or faulty control valve spool seal
Solution: Perform cylinder drift test to measure drift rate. If excessive (more than 2 inches in 5 minutes), inspect cylinder rod seals and piston seals. Test control valve for internal leakage. Replace cylinder seals or control valve as needed.

---

Problem: Starter motor cranks slowly or clicks but won't turn engine
Equipment: Komatsu PC200-8 Excavator
Error Codes: None
Cause: Weak battery, corroded battery connections, or faulty starter motor
Solution: Test battery voltage (should be 12.5-13.0V when engine off). Load test battery under cranking conditions. Clean and tighten battery terminals. Test voltage drop across starter connections. If starter is faulty, remove and rebuild or replace.

---

Problem: Hydraulic oil overheating (temperature exceeds 180°F)
Equipment: Volvo EC480D Excavator
Error Codes: HY001
Cause: Hydraulic oil cooler restriction or main relief valve stuck partially open causing excessive bypass flow
Solution: Check hydraulic oil temperature sensor calibration. Inspect oil cooler for blockage - clean fins if needed. Check coolant flow through oil cooler. Test main relief valve setting (should be 350 bar). Adjust or replace relief valve if out of specification.

---

Problem: Electrical system intermittently loses power, gauges go dark
Equipment: Case 580 Backhoe
Error Codes: None
Cause: Loose or corroded main ground connection or failing alternator
Solution: Inspect all main ground connections between battery, frame, and engine. Clean and tighten ground connections. Test alternator output (should be 13.8-14.5V at idle). Check battery cables for internal corrosion. Test main fuse panel connections.
